## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned a lot from this challenge, I learned NextJS which I had only worked with quickly in another project previously. I wish I would challenge myself more with things that I was previously not familiar with, but that's for next challenge.

### Continued development

This was my first mobile-first solution and I'd love to further develop my skills in this and keep making new projects with mobile-first in mind. I would also in the next project dabble in animations, to make the transition between desktop and mobile more seemless and just an overall nicer experience for my users. I definitely also want to get a deeper understanding for NextJS as it is quite different from version 12 that I was a bit familiar with compared to this version which was 13.

I want to thank my team at my workplace who helped me with advice on how to think when working with mobile-first. Also big thanks to the FrontendMentor community, especially on discord where I could get help and inspiration.
